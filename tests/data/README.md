# Dummy Test Data

Contains two sets of dummy datasets and models:

- `cities`: Text with questions like "what is the capital of france? the capital of france is paris". The dataset only has a "text" column, it's not structured as a question/answer dataset.

- `tofu`: A small dataset of synthetic authors aiming to mimic the TOFU dataset. It has a single split with "question" and "answer" columns.
